# CLI API V1 Introduction



## Introduction

This is a direct API to the app from the Command Line Interface.

There is a configuration setting, CLIAPI1Enabled. This is off by default. Simply turn on to enable the API.

Note it has no security once enabled. Any program can call the API, specifying any user. This is a low level API that is intended to be used by very tight integrations.

If you need a higher-level API with user security, use the Web API V2 instead.
