# Extension: Curated lists

This extension MUST be installed currently.

Historically, this was part of the Core software and was moved out to it's own extension later. Some parts of the Core software still reference this extension and may cause errors is this extension is not installed.

## Installation

This extension is included with the core software and only needs to be set up.

## Setting up

Edit your config.php and add CuratedLists as an extension.
