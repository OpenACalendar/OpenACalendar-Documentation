# WordPress Plugin

There is a WordPress plugin.

This lets you place a widget in your layout that will pull events from your 
calendar and display them in your WordPress site.

[Download Stable Releases from the WordPress site](http://wordpress.org/plugins/openacalendar/) or 
[browse the latest code on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenACalendar/OpenACalendar-Web-WordPress).
