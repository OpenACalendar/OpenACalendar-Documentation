# Build folder

The build folder contains scripts to build assets (JS, CSS, images) for developers.

JS, CSS and images should be stored in a folder in an extension. If a later extension has 
an asset with the same name as an earlier one, it overrides the earlier one. In this way, 
a extension can theme and style a site without having to edit the "Core" extension.
