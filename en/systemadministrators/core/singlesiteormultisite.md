# Single Site Mode and Multi Site Mode

## Single Site Mode

Single Site means that the installed code base only runs one calendar. 
See Open Tech Calendar for an example. http://opentechcalendar.co.uk
This is the simpler mode to install.

In Single Site Mode, one calendar is set up then simply used as the calendar for all requests.
Thus it is possible to turn a site from Single Site Mode into Multi Site Mode.

## Multi Site Mode

Multi Site means that the installed code base can run more than one calendar. 
See HasACalendar for an example. http://ican.hasacalendar.co.uk
This is the more complex mode to install.

You need to be set up several web roots with several different virtual hosts. 
One of them will need a domain name that allows subdomains configured (eg *.example.com).
