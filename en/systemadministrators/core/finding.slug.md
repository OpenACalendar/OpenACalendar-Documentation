# Finding Slug

At times in the system administrators UI you will be asked to enter the slug of a piece of data. This can be found by looking at the URL.

The Slug is the ID number of the data, up to the first hyphen only.

For example,
  *  the slug of http://hasadevcalendar.co.uk:20153/event/28-test/ is 28
  *  the slug of http://hasadevcalendar.co.uk:20153/group/4-3-good-people/ is 4
  *  the slug of http://hasadevcalendar.co.uk:20153/venue/3-two-towers/ is 3
