# Duplicate Data

Sometimes the same venue, group or event is entered into the system twice.

The system administrator has a feature to mark one as a duplcate of the other. This will delete the dulpicate and move any attached data to the original.

For instance, if you mark one venue as a duplicate of another, any events at that venue will now be marked as being at the original venue.

## How to purge?

Browse the System Administors user interface.

Find the bit of data you want to mark as a duplicate and enter the command "isduplicateof slug", where slug is the slug of the original bit of data.
