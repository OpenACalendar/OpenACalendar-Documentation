# Extension: Meetup

## Purpose

This extension provides interaction with Meetup.

## Importing by URL

If someone tries to import a single event or a group from Meetup by URL, this extension will import the data.

If this extension is not set up, the data will still be imported but in a reduced form. 
For example, the description will be truncated.

## Useage

If set up properly, it will just work.
