# Personal Calendar
	
Any logged-in user can have there own personal and private calendar. 

You can add to your personal calendar by:

  * saying you will or may attend an event.
  * [watching a group or site](/en/users/core/watch.md).

You can browse your calendar on site or export it into your personal calendar software.


When a user specifies their plans for an event they can also choose to make them public. 
In this case, this will be visible to other people on:

  * their user profile, to share with others.
  * on the event itself.
