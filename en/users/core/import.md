# Import


We can import content from other sites.

  * Eventbrite
  * Meetup
  * Lanyrd
  * Any iCal feed, such as Google Calendar

Feeds must be added in a group. To add a feed, simply go to the group you want and click new event.

Copy in the URL of the content:

  * For EventBrite, copy in the page. eg. http://startupschristmas.eventbrite.co.uk/
  * For Meetup, copy in the page. eg. http://www.meetup.com/ORG-Edinburgh/
  * For Lanyrd, copy in the page. eg. http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/
  * For a iCal feed, copy in the feed address. eg. http://www.wpscotland.org/?eme_ical=public

Note data from feeds will only be imported several months in advance, and only 
  a maximum number of events will be imported at once.

Feeds can be disabled or enabled by editing them.

After a number of months, feeds will expire. This is to prevent old data 
continuing to be importing if the feed is no longer valid. When we expire a feed,
we email everyone watching that group. If you know that the feed is still 
valid, you can simply press "enable" to re-enable it.
